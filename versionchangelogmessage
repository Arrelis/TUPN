Changelog for version "Development Beta 23.1 / Pending" :

- Fixed "Custom challenges stopped working"
- Fixed "Weekly challenges that had powerups disabled didn't work properly"

- Concerns: I experienced the crash myself and I don't knwo if I will be able to fix it right now, but it only happened to me once. Also, I don't know how reliable disabling powerups for weekly challenges is at the moment.
