Changelog for 1.1.0-b:

- Fixed a bug where the Take-Out won't make the Water Pipe System animatronics reset, even if they will stop moving
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't access the old save system if there was a save file selected
- Fixed a bug where the Take-Out would remove Emily from the night, but you still had to deal with her one last time
