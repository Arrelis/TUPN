Changelog:
- Added all the new characters that had icons before
- Fixed a lot of bugs 
- Basement halls door no longer draws power, but can malfunction
- Added some refinements and small tweaks to previous gameplay
- Made the other new characters available for Golden Shell to add

NOTE: Please give me suggestions on how I should balance the game with the new characters that I added in the Beta Testing Server.
Have fun trying out these new challengers!
