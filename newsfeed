Sorry!
I appeared to have missed a weekly challenge, it was Easter for me. New one should be out soon.

Update 1.1.2 is out.

This is a test feed to make sure everything works, so if you see this, then great!

Changelog:

- Added a new intro (it apparently inflates the file size)
- Changed how you change character difficulty, making it so you don't need a scrollwheel.
- Made some changes to the main menu
